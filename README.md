# PortfolioSite
Developing and (Finally) hosting my first online portfolio

Slow and Steady Wins The Race
-----------------------------
After a long deliberation with myself (and many other engineers in the field),
I have decided to hand-code my website instead of using
wordpress, squarespace or other CMS, with my current know-how.

Once I finish with the core, I will host, experiment, and periodically update
the site as I go along with new tools.

Made using:
>HTML5 Boilerplate
>CSS
>JavaScript
